# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

## Introduction
Spam emails, often filled with scams, phishing content, or cryptic messages, are a common nuisance. This project demonstrates how to use Python and machine learning to develop an **email spam detection system**. The model classifies emails as either spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques.
- Multiple classification algorithms tested and evaluated.
- Voting and stacking ensemble methods for improved performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), downloaded from Kaggle. It contains labeled messages as spam or non-spam.

## Project Steps

### 1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Analyzed data shape and structure (`df.shape`, `df.info()`).
- Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Dropped duplicate entries.
- Renamed columns for better readability.

### 3. **Text Preprocessing**
- Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lowercasing using `nltk`.
- Added new features such as:
  - Number of characters.
  - Number of words.
  - Number of sentences.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
- Visualized spam vs non-spam distributions using pie charts and histograms.
- Generated word clouds for spam and non-spam messages.

### 5. **Feature Engineering**
- Used `TfidfVectorizer` for text vectorization, limiting features to the top 3000.

### 6. **Model Building and Evaluation**
- Implemented multiple classifiers, including:
  - Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVC)
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Evaluated models based on accuracy and precision.

### 7. **Ensemble Techniques**
- Voting Classifier: Combined Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Stacking Classifier: Used Random Forest as the final estimator.

## Results
The final model achieved:
- **Accuracy**: 98.16%
- **Precision**: 87.79%

## Key Libraries Used
- **Data Analysis**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`
- **NLP**: `nltk`
- **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning.ipynb` to train and test models.
2. Modify the code for further experimentation or analysis.

## Visualization Samples
- Word clouds for spam and non-spam messages.
- Correlation heatmaps and feature pair plots.
- Histograms of word and character distributions.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate deep learning techniques for better classification.
- Add additional datasets for robustness.
- Build a web-based or CLI application for real-time spam detection.
